1. Checkout the latest cfitsio from the repository and make sure you're setup to
run Borland C++.  You can't make a proper dll/def file pair that will work with both 
Borland and VC++ using VC++ (I know, you're shocked :), so you've got to use Borland
to build unless we drop support for Borland.

2. 'del make.com'  or you can't type 'make' without trying to run this old VMS
relic.

3. 'make -f makefile.bc' This should generate cfitsio.def and cfitsio.dll, along
the way it will make windumpexts.exe to write the cfitsio.def file.

4. To wrap up the distribution, put the following files into a zip file. You may
want to rename README_WINUSER to README before putting it in the distribution for
consistency with past releases but whatever.


cfitsio.def
cfitsio.dll
fitsio.h
longnam.h
README_WINUSER ---->README
testprog.c
testprog.std
testprog.tpt

5. Unzip your distribution to a temporary directory and follow the WINUSER README to
build and run the test program with VC++ and Borland to be sure it works.
