         Log of Changes Made to CFITSIO

Version 1.03 - 20 August 1996

   - added full support for reading and writing the C 'int'
     data type.  This was a problem on Alpha/OSF where short,
     int, and long datatypes are 2, 4, and 8 bytes long, respectively.

   - cleaned up the code in the byte-swapping routines.

   - renamed the file 'longname.h' to 'longnam.h' to avoid conflict
     with a file with the same name in another unrelated package.

Version 1.02 - 15 August 1996

   - ffgtbp was not correctly reading the THEAP keyword, hence would
     not correctly read variable length data in binary tables if
     the heap was not at the default starting location (i.e., 
     starting immeadiately after the fixed length table).

   - now force the cbuff variable in ffpcl_ and ffgcl_ to be
     aligned on a double word boundary.  Non-alignment can
     cause program to crash on some systems.

Version 1.01 - 12 August 1996

   - initial public release
