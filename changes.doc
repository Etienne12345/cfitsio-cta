         Log of Changes Made to CFITSIO


Version 1.04 - 

   - added README.MacOS and cfitsio_mac.sit.hqx to the distribution
     to support the Mac platforms.

   - fixed bug in ffpdfl that caused an EOF error (107) when a program
     creats a new extention that is an exact multiple of 2880 bytes long,
     AND the program does not write a value to the last element
     in the table or image.

   - fixed bug in all the ffgsf* and ffgcv* routines which caused
     core dumps when reading null values in a table.

Version 1.03 - 20 August 1996

   - added full support for reading and writing the C 'int'
     data type.  This was a problem on Alpha/OSF where short,
     int, and long datatypes are 2, 4, and 8 bytes long, respectively.

   - cleaned up the code in the byte-swapping routines.

   - renamed the file 'longname.h' to 'longnam.h' to avoid conflict
     with a file with the same name in another unrelated package.

Version 1.02 - 15 August 1996

   - ffgtbp was not correctly reading the THEAP keyword, hence would
     not correctly read variable length data in binary tables if
     the heap was not at the default starting location (i.e., 
     starting immediately after the fixed length table).

   - now force the cbuff variable in ffpcl_ and ffgcl_ to be
     aligned on a double word boundary.  Non-alignment can
     cause program to crash on some systems.

Version 1.01 - 12 August 1996

   - initial public release
