         Log of Changes Made to CFITSIO

Version 1.101 - 

   - Made major I/O efficiency improvements by adding internal buffers
     rather than directly reading or writing to disk.  Access to 
     columns in binary tables is now 50 - 150 times fasters.  Access to
     FITS image is also slightly faster.

   - made significant speed improvements when reading numerical data
     in FITS ASCII tables by writing my own number parsing routines
     rather than using the sscanf C library routine.  This change
     requires that the -lm argument now be included when linking
     a program that calls cfitsio (under UNIX).

   - regrouped the source files into logically related sets of routines.
     The Makefile now runs much faster since every single routine is
     not split into a separate file.

   - now use the memcpy function, rather than a 'for' loop in several
     places for added efficiency

   - redesigned the low-level binary table read and write routines
     (ffpbytoff and ffgbytoff) for greater efficiency.

   - added a new error status: 103 = too many open FITS files.

   - added a 'extern "C"' statement around the function prototypes
     in fitsio.h, to support use of cfitsio by C++ compilers.

   - fixed routines for writing or reading fixed-length substrings
     within a binary table ASCII column, with TFORM values of
     of the form 'rAw' where 'r' is the total width of the ASCII
     column and 'w' is the width of a substring within the column.

   - no longer automatically rewrite the END card and following fill
     values if they are already correct.

   - all the 'get keyword value and comment' routines have been changed 
     so that the comment is not returned if the input pointer is NULL.

   - added new routine to return the optimum number of tables rows
     that should be read or written at one time for optimum efficiency.

   - modified the way numerical values in ASCII tables are parsed so
     that embedded spaces in the value are ignored, and implicit
     decimal points are now supported.   (e.g, the string '123E 12'
     in a 'E10.2' format column will be interpreted as 1.23 * 10**12).

   - modified ffpcl and ffgcl to support binary table columns of
     all datatype (added logical, bit, complex, and double complex)

   - when writing numerical data to ASCII table columns, the ffpcl_
     routines now return an overflow error if a value is too large
     to be expressed in the column format.

   - closed small memory leak in ffpcls.

   - initialized the 'incre' variable in ffgcpr to eliminate compiler warning.

Version 1.04 - 17 Sept 1996

   - added README.MacOS and cfitsio_mac.sit.hqx to the distribution
     to support the Mac platforms.

   - fixed bug in ffpdfl that caused an EOF error (107) when a program
     creats a new extention that is an exact multiple of 2880 bytes long,
     AND the program does not write a value to the last element
     in the table or image.

   - fixed bug in all the ffgsf* and ffgcv* routines which caused
     core dumps when reading null values in a table.

Version 1.03 - 20 August 1996

   - added full support for reading and writing the C 'int'
     data type.  This was a problem on Alpha/OSF where short,
     int, and long datatypes are 2, 4, and 8 bytes long, respectively.

   - cleaned up the code in the byte-swapping routines.

   - renamed the file 'longname.h' to 'longnam.h' to avoid conflict
     with a file with the same name in another unrelated package.

Version 1.02 - 15 August 1996

   - ffgtbp was not correctly reading the THEAP keyword, hence would
     not correctly read variable length data in binary tables if
     the heap was not at the default starting location (i.e., 
     starting immediately after the fixed length table).

   - now force the cbuff variable in ffpcl_ and ffgcl_ to be
     aligned on a double word boundary.  Non-alignment can
     cause program to crash on some systems.

Version 1.01 - 12 August 1996

   - initial public release
