                   CFITSIO Interface Routines

                           July 1996

CFITSIO is a library of ANSI C routines for reading and writing FITS
format files.  The design of these C routines closely follows the
Fortran subroutines provided in the original fitsio library.  The
CFITSIO User's Guide, in the file cfitsio.ps (postscript format) or
cfitsio.doc (plain ASCII text) contains full instructions on building
and using this library.

This new CFITSIO library, written entirely in ANSI C, should not be
confused with the previously available set of C macros which provide a
C-callable interface to the Fortran fitsio routines.  These older
macros are contained in the cfitsio.h file that is distributed along
with the Fortran fitsio source files.

BUILDING CFITSIO
----------------

The CFITSIO code is contained in the following 9 source files:
  cfileio.c, convert.c, fitscore.c, getcol.c, getkey.c, modkey.c,
  putcol.c, putkey.c, and utilproc.c. The fitsio.h, fitsio2.h, and
  longname.h header files are also needed.

On VAX/VMS systems 2 additional macro-code files are needed:
   vmsieeed.mar and vmsieeer.mar

On VAX/VMS and ALPHA/VMS systems, the makevaxvms.com and makealphavms.com
command files may be used to build the cfitsio.olb object library
(e.g., type '@makevaxvms' at the Vax command line to build the CFITSIO
library on a Vax).

The CFITSIO library is built on Unix systems by typing:

   % configure
   % make

at the operating system prompt.  The 'configure' command customizes
the Makefile for your particular system, then the 'make' command
builds the library.  The build process splits each routine in the
source files into a separate disk file in a scratch subdirectory.
Depending on the speed of the CPU, it can anywhere from a couple
minutes to an hour to create the libcfitsio.a library file.

TESTING CFITSIO
---------------

The CFITSIO library should be tested by building and running
the testprog.c program that is included with the release.  On VMS systems,
type (assuming cc is the name of the C compiler command):

$ cc testprog.c
$ link testprog, cfitsio/lib
$ run testprog

On Unix systems (assuming the gcc compiler is being used), type:

% gcc -o testprog testprog.c -L. -lcfitsio
% testprog > testprog.lis
% diff testprog.lis testprog.out
% cmp testprog.fit testprog.std

The testprog program should produce a FITS file called testprog.fit
which is identical to the testprog.std FITS file included in this
release.  The diagnotic messages sent to standard output (which are
piped to the file testprog.lis in the above example) should be
identical to the listing contained in the file testprog.out.  The
'diff' and 'cmp' commands shown above should not report any differences
in the files.


USING CFITSIO
-------------

The CFITSIO User's Guide, contained in the files cfitsio.doc (plain
text file) and cfitsio.ps (postscript file), provides detailed
documentation about how to build and use the CFITSIO library.
It contains a description of every user-callable routine in the
CFITSIO interface.

The cookbook.c file provides some sample routines for performing common
operations on various types of FITS files.  Programmers are urged to
examine these routines for recommended programming practices when using
CFITSIO.  Users are free to copy or modify these routines for their own
purposes.

The cookbook program produces 2 FITS files, atestfil.fit and
btestfil.fit.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

CFITSIO has currently been tested on the following platforms:

   Operating System          Compiler
   ----------------          --------
   Sun OS                     gcc
   Sun Solaris                gcc
   Silicon Graphics IRIX      gcc and cc
   DECstation  Ultrix         gcc
   Dec Alpha OSF/1            gcc
   Dec Alpha OpenVMS          cc with /float=gfloat or /float=ieee options
   DEC VAX/VMS                gcc
   IBM PC w/ Windows 95       Borland C++ V4.5
   Linux running on IBM PC    gcc
   Mac IIci                   Symantec C++

CFITSIO will probably run on most other Unix platforms without
modification.  Cray supercomputers and IBM mainframe computers are
currently not supported.

Reports of any success or failure to run CFITSIO on other platforms
would be appreciated.  Any problem reports or suggestions for
improvements are also welcome.  Please send any reports to the author

 - The routines that deal with FITS world coordinate system keywords
   have not yet been implemented.
